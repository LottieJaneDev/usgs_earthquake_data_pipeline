0,1.9,Micro,I,"Microearthquakes, not felt. Recorded by seismographs.[12]",Continual/several million per year
2,2.9,Minor,I,Felt slightly by some people. No damage to buildings.,Over one million per year
3,3.9,Slight,II to III,"Often felt by people, but very rarely causes damage. Shaking of indoor objects can be noticeable.","Over 100,000 per year"
4,4.9,Light,IV to V,Noticeable shaking of indoor objects and rattling noises. Felt by most people in the affected area. Slightly felt outside. Generally causes zero to minimal damage. Moderate to significant damage is very unlikely. Some objects may fall off shelves or be knocked over.,"10,000 to 15,000 per year"
5,5.9,Moderate,VI to VII,Can cause damage of varying severity to poorly constructed buildings. Zero to slight damage to all other buildings. Felt by everyone.,"1,000 to 1,500 per year"
6,6.9,Strong,VII to IX,Damage to a moderate number of well-built structures in populated areas. Earthquake-resistant structures survive with slight to moderate damage. Poorly designed structures receive moderate to severe damage. Felt in wider areas; up to hundreds of kilometers from the epicenter. Strong to violent shaking in the epicentral area.,100 to 150 per year
7,7.9,Major,VIII or higher,"Causes damage to most buildings, some to partially or completely collapse or receive severe damage. Well-designed structures are likely to receive damage. Felt across great distances with major damage mostly limited to 250 km from the epicenter.",10 to 20 per year
8,8.9,Great,,"Major damage to buildings, and structures likely to be destroyed. Will cause moderate to heavy damage to sturdy or earthquake-resistant buildings. Damaging in large areas. Felt in extremely large regions.",One per year
9,10,Extreme,,Near total destruction – severe damage or collapse to all buildings. Heavy damage and shaking extend to distant locations. Permanent changes in ground topography.,One to three per century[13]
